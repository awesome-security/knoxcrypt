TeaSafe: An encrypted container format
--------------------------------------

##### What is it?

- TeaSafe is an independently developed encrypted container format
- supports the following ciphers: AES candidates (AES [Rijndael], Serpent, CAST-256, RC6, Twofish, and MARS) and Camellia, RC5 and SHACAL2 
- utilizes scrypt for key derivation
- can create sparse containers
- can create and use multiple sub-volumes
- employs a very simple and custom developed filesystem (see wiki).
- TeaSafe containers can be browsed using either of the provided shell or gui interfaces
- can also use the provided FUSE-layer for more realistic filesystem interoperability

### Notes and caveats

- The motivation for this toy project is to provide an educational testbed. Although relatively sophisticated there are known weaknesses to the underlying cryptosystem which with the correct tools could be exploited. The main exploit concerns the underlying crypto mode being CTR which for filesystem-level encryption is not recommended. 
- CTR (counter) mode works by XORing the clear text with a stream of encrypted numbers (the counter at successive increments). Because of this, if chunks of the ciphertext change over time (which is likely in a filesystem), it is rather trivial to derive the original clear-text by combining the different ciphertext versions together. 
- We could use a far stronger mode of encryption such as XTS. However, incorporating it hinges on the underlying crypto api having implemented it and unfortunately the current version hasn't (as of yet).

As a result, probably best not to use this tool for anything critical. 

### Compiling

Note, only tested on Linux and Mac. With a bit of work, will probably build (sans fuse-bits) on windows
too.

Note:
 
- requires some of the boost headers and libraries to build (see makefile).
- requires fuse for the main fuse layer binary (the binary 'teasafe')
- requires crypto++ headers and libraries for building and linking

If you don't have fuse installed, you'll probably want to only build the main 
teasafe library (libteasafe.a), the shell (teashell) and maketeasafe, the binary
used to make teasafe containers. To build these, respectively:
<pre>
make lib
make shell
make maketeasafe
</pre>
Note that building either of the binaries `teashell` or `maketeasafe` will automatically build 
libteasafe.a first.

`make` or `make all` will compile everything except the GUI, i.e., the following binaries:

<pre>
test         : unit tests various parts of the main api
maketeasafe  : builds teasafe containers
teasafe      : fuse layer used for mounting teasafe containers
teashell     : shell utility used for accessing and modifying teasafe containers
</pre>

To build a teasafe container that uses AES256, with 4096 * 128000 bytes, use the `maketeasafe` binary:

<pre>
./maketeasafe ./test.bfs 128000
</pre>

For alternative ciphers, use the `--cipher` flag, e.g.:

<pre>
./maketeasafe ./test.vfs 128000 --cipher twofish
</pre>

The available cipher options are `aes`, `serpent`, `cast256`, `rc6`, `twofish`, `mars`, `camellia`, `rc5`, `shacal2` and `null`.

Note that `null` disables encryption and thus provides no security. The default is aes.

Sparse containers can be created too meaning that they start off small and dynamically
grow as more data are written to them. Just use the `--sparse` flag during creation, i.e.:

<pre>
./maketeasafe ./test.bfs 128000 --sparse 1
</pre>

Now to mount it to `/testMount` via fuse, use the `teasafe` binary:

<pre>
./teasafe ./test.bfs /testMount
</pre>

Runs the interactive shell on it using the `teashell` binary:

<pre>
./teashell ./test.bfs
</pre>

### Building the GUI

To build the GUI, first make sure that `libteasafe.a` has been built by issuing the
command `make lib` in the top-level build-folder. 

The GUI uses Qt. Please download and install the latest version (Qt 5.3 at the time
of writing) and open gui.pro in QtCreator. Build and run by clicking on the build icon.

The GUI provides a simple interface to browsing and manipulating TeaSafe containers.
